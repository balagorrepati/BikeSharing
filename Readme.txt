# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment
> You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

## General Information

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.  Company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after lockdown ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions

- Company should focus on expanding business during Spring.
- Company should focus on expanding business during September.
- Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
